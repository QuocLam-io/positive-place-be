## General Information
Positive Place was designed to provide an easily accessible and low effort service to improve mental health. There's emerging evidence that practicing gratitude on a daily basis not only produce an immediate relief but also trains the brain to develop the mental faculties to consistently recognize the qualities of life that are normally taken for granted. The app recognizes that it is unhealthy to be in a state of constantly desiring a positive outcome, so there is a mode referred to as "Negative Space" that's reserved for days to air grievances. The Negative Mode is triggered by a custom toggle, affectionately named Mr. Merp, on the bottom right corner of the screen. The app supports User Authentication and has backend support to revisit, edit, and delete previous posts.
